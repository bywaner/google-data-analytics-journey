**Key takeaways:**
- Data is most powerful when it helps ask better questions — not just provide answers.
- The data life cycle is deeply human: it involves stakeholders, ethics, communication, and action.
- “Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information.”
